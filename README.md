Be fridgeful, not wasteful.*

A great amount of food is thrown out every day either because of items passing their expiration date, or because individuals don't know what to do with their leftovers, letting them sit in their fridge until they go bad. To promote the awareness of sustainability and food waste reduction, we wanted to create a tool for users to manage the items in their fridge, allowing them to check on expiration dates, and suggesting recipes to use up ingredients that are expiring soon.

Fridgeful is an Android mobile application that we designed and built using Android Studio and Java. It allows users to take inventory of their fridge and add items into a database, including the expiration date and food group of the food item. Based on which foods are expiring soonest, fridgeful recommends recipes that the user can try to use up their food. Since many people have their hands full when unloading food into their fridge, we also created an app for Google Assistant using Voiceflow which allows users to add items to their fridge using voice commands. This gives the user ease of remote access, ease of use, and makes maintaining your fridge practical. We used the Google Sheets API, which is integrated into Voiceflow, as a database to store the current items in the user’s fridge.

Due to time constraints, we had difficulties connecting our mobile app to the same Google Sheet as the Voiceflow application. In the future, we would like to fully connect both the Android application and the Google Assistant application to Google Sheets, so that the user can maintain their fridge from either platform for practicality and easy, remote access. We would like to add the ability to scan expiration dates to make the process even easier for users, which could potentially be done using the Google Vision API.
